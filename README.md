# What is the Web3stat project?

#### Web3stat is a social game community, a space to explore new P2E games, exchange information, and organize guilds to maximize profits. Our platform is a hub that connects experienced game users, guilds, and play-to-earn games. 
#### Anyone can contribute Web3stat project and can earn 'MESO' coin by contributing code, writing some tips for games, making a guild, doing quests and bootstrapping NEW blockchain game projects.
